# User Story

AS a Sudoku Enthusiast,
I WANT to play my favourite game with more functionality.
SO THAT,  I can satisfy my desire to experience new kinds of Sudoku.


Features:
- Colourful sudoku game with extra features.
- Responsive Design: The game can be played on any size screen.
- Sound effects on buttons and changing gifs for interest.
- A high scores page to record and compare your scores (with cool music at the end!).
- Play the game at 3 different levels.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a Sudoku game that could also be entertaining.

### Challenges

It was a challenge to map the api result to the grid. The api was also tempremental at times! Getting to grips with state was important for the sounds and we still have improvements to make here.
